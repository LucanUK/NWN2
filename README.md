## Importing a Existing Charater
If you have a character created in single player, you can export the character for use on the server

* Export Character from in NWN2
* Goto your "Documents" folder in My Computer
* Then goto "Neverwinter Nights 2\localvault"
* Send me the .bic file for your character and also the BioWare Account name used for multiplayer

Enjoy!
